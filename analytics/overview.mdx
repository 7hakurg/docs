## Implementation Examples

### Feature Flags in Action

Control features without deploying:

```javascript
// Check feature status
if (window.oppla.getFeatureFlagStatus('new-checkout')) {
  renderNewCheckout();
} else {
  renderLegacyCheckout();
}

// Target specific users
window.oppla.identify('user_123', {
  plan: 'premium',
  company: 'Acme Corp'
});
// Premium users automatically get premium features
```

### Running Experiments

Test variations with confidence:

```javascript
// Get experiment variant
const variant = window.oppla.getExperimentStatus('pricing-test');

if (variant === 'variant-a') {
  showNewPricing();
} else {
  showOriginalPricing();
}

// Track conversion
window.oppla.track('purchase-completed', {
  experiment: 'pricing-test',
  variant: variant,
  revenue: 99.99
});
```

### Automation Triggers

Automate based on user behavior:

```javascript
// Trigger automation when user is at risk
if (lastLoginDaysAgo > 14) {
  window.oppla.trigger('churn-risk', 'auto_retention', {
    user_id: userId,
    days_inactive: lastLoginDaysAgo,
    lifetime_value: userLTV
  });
  // Automatically sends win-back email and Slack alert
}
```
