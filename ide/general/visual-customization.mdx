This guide helps you tailor Oppla's visual experience — from themes and syntax highlighting to panel layouts, icons, fonts, and accessibility options. It explains quick actions, configuration snippets, accessibility checks, and best practices so you and your team get a predictable, readable UI that works well with AI features.

Why this matters
- Visual clarity improves comprehension and reduces cognitive load when using AI suggestions.
- Consistent styling helps teams review AI-generated diffs and makes automated suggestions easier to validate.
- Accessibility ensures everyone can use Oppla effectively (contrast, font sizes, keyboard navigation).

1 — Getting started: Pick or enable an adaptive theme
-----------------------------------------
Oppla ships with AI-aware themes and an adaptive mode that can switch themes based on time of day, ambient conditions, or your activity. To enable adaptive themes:

1. Open Preferences → Settings → Theme
2. Choose mode: `system`, `dark`, `light`, or `ai_adaptive`
3. Optionally set light/dark fallbacks

Example (user settings snippet)
```docs/ide/configuring-oppla.mdx#L1-60
{
  "theme": {
    "mode": "ai_adaptive",
    "light": "Oppla Light",
    "dark": "Oppla Dark",
    "experimental.theme_overrides": {
      "editor.background": "#0f1724",
      "ai.suggestion.background": "#10203a",
      "ai.suggestion.border": "#F5A742"
    }
  }
}
```

Tip: Use `ai_adaptive` on laptops to reduce eye strain during long sessions. The AI recommends theme adjustments when enabled.

2 — Theme overrides & AI-specific colors
-----------------------------------------
Oppla supports custom theme attributes to highlight AI suggestions distinctly from user code. Use `experimental.theme_overrides` to tweak these attributes.

Common AI-specific tokens:
- `ai.suggestion.background` — background color for AI suggestion blocks
- `ai.suggestion.border` — border for suggestion previews
- `ai.inline.hint` — inline hint text color
- `ai.completion.highlight` — highlight for accepted AI completions

Example theme override (local theme file)
```docs/ide/configuration/themes.mdx#L1-40
{
  "name": "my-ai-theme",
  "colors": {
    "editor.background": "#0b1220",
    "editor.foreground": "#dbe7ff",
    "ai.suggestion.background": "#122033",
    "ai.suggestion.border": "#F5A742",
    "ai.inline.hint": "#9fb2ff"
  }
}
```

Store local themes in `~/.config/oppla/themes/` and restart Oppla (or reload themes from the command palette) to load them.

3 — Workspace layout & panels
-----------------------------------------
Optimize panel layout for AI workflows:

- Recommended layout for agent-heavy workflows:
  - Left: Project tree / Explorer
  - Center: Editor (multi-tab)
  - Right: Agent Panel / Text Threads
  - Bottom: Terminal / Test Runner / Output
  - Top: Command Palette (pop-up)

Use the View menu or drag panels to create and save workspace layouts. Save workspace presets for different tasks (development, code review, debugging).

Keyboard-driven layout changes
- Use the Command Palette (`Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P`) and search "Layout: Save Workspace" or "Layout: Toggle Panel".

4 — Fonts, ligatures, and sizing
-----------------------------------------
Choose fonts that maximize code readability at your preferred size. Recommended fonts:
- Inter / Inter UI (UI & variable fonts)
- JetBrains Mono (monospace, excellent for ligatures)
- Fira Code (popular with ligatures)
- Source Code Pro (classic, wide support)

Performance tip: When using Edit Prediction and inline AI hints, prefer a monospaced font with clear punctuation to avoid subtle glyph confusion in suggested edits.

Example font settings
```docs/ide/configuring-oppla.mdx#L61-120
{
  "editor": {
    "fontFamily": "JetBrains Mono, Menlo, monospace",
    "fontSize": 14,
    "fontLigatures": true,
    "lineHeight": 1.5
  }
}
```

5 — Icons & file decorations
-----------------------------------------
File icons help quick visual parsing of repositories. You can:
- Enable built-in icon set (Preferences → Appearance → File Icons)
- Install or enable icon extensions via the marketplace (see ../extensions/overview.mdx)
- Configure badge styles for AI-suggested edits, lint errors, and test status in the Tree view

6 — Accessibility checklist
-----------------------------------------
Before shipping a theme or recommending a team-wide layout, validate these items:

- Contrast ratios: Ensure foreground/background pass WCAG AA (4.5:1 for normal text). Use automated checks on theme colors.
- Focus outlines: Keyboard focus must be visible for panels and interactive controls.
- Scalable UI: UI scales properly when font sizes or OS scaling changes.
- High-contrast mode: Provide a high-contrast variant or follow OS high-contrast settings.
- Screen reader labels: Panels and controls should expose accessible names.

Accessibility testing action items:
- Run an automated contrast checker on theme palette.
- Manually test keyboard-only navigation for common flows (open file, accept AI suggestion, run agent).
- Validate screen reader output on macOS VoiceOver and Linux Orca where possible.

7 — Visual treatment for AI content (guidelines)
-----------------------------------------
Design recommendations when highlighting AI-generated content:

- Use a subtle background tint rather than saturated color.
- Provide a clear "suggested by AI" label with optional source model/provider metadata for transparency.
- Use borders and small icons (e.g., a robot spark) to distinguish AI suggestions from user edits.
- Provide dismiss and accept affordances inline (Tab = accept by default, Esc = dismiss), configurable in keybindings. See ../configuration/key-bindings.mdx.

8 — Themes for collaboration & reviews
-----------------------------------------
When teams review AI-generated patches, prefer themes that:
- Keep diffs clear (strong color separation for additions/deletions).
- Highlight language-specific tokens (function names, types) consistently.
- Emphasize comments and TODOs (so reviewers can spot unsafe auto-changes quickly).

9 — Creating a theme for Oppla marketplace
-----------------------------------------
If you plan to publish themes, follow these best practices:
- Provide a README with accessibility notes (contrast checks & font guidance).
- Include a "Preview" image and alt text.
- Expose `ai.*` token overrides to make your theme AI-friendly.
- Test your theme with common languages in Oppla and show before/after screenshots.

10 — Troubleshooting & tips
-----------------------------------------
- Theme not applying? Restart Oppla or reload the window.
- Inline hints overlap code? Adjust `editor.lineHeight` and `ai.inline.hint` spacing in theme overrides.
- Suggestions hard to see on your monitor: tweak `ai.suggestion.border` and `ai.suggestion.background` for stronger separation.
- Want team consistency? Store a recommended theme file in your repo under `.oppla/theme.json` and document a "Use this theme" step in your CONTRIBUTING.md.

If you want, I can:
- Produce ready-to-use theme JSON files (dark/light/high-contrast).
- Generate screenshot assets and alt text for the theme gallery.
- Create a linter/checker that validates contrast ratios for custom themes.
