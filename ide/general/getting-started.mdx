If this script is insufficient for your use case, you run into problems running Oppla, or there are errors in uninstalling Oppla, please see our [Linux-specific documentation](./linux.mdx).

## Command Palette with AI Intelligence

The Command Palette is your gateway to Oppla's AI-powered functionality. It's not just a command runner - it's an intelligent assistant that learns your patterns and suggests actions based on your context. The keybinding is the first one you should familiarize yourself with. To open it, hit: `Cmd+Shift+P` (macOS) or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Linux).

<Note>

</Note>

Try it! Open the Command Palette and type in `new file`. Watch as Oppla's AI not only filters commands but also suggests file types based on your recent work patterns. You should see the list of commands being intelligently filtered to `workspace: new file` along with AI-suggested templates. Hit return and you'll get a new buffer with smart defaults based on your project context.

Any time you see instructions that include commands of the form `oppla: ...` or `editor: ...` and so on, that means you need to execute them in the Command Palette. Our AI assistant will help you discover related commands and workflows.

## CLI with Intelligent Automation

Oppla has a powerful CLI that leverages AI to understand your intent and automate repetitive tasks. On Linux, this comes with the distribution's Oppla package. For macOS, the CLI comes in the same package with the editor binary, and can be installed into the system with the `cli: install` Oppla command which will create a symlink to `/usr/local/bin/oppla`.

Use `oppla --help` to see the full list of capabilities enhanced by AI.

General highlights:

- **Opening another Oppla window with AI context**: `oppla` - Opens with your most recent project context
- **Opening a file or directory with intelligent setup**: `oppla /path/to/entry` (use `-n` to open in a new window) - Oppla automatically configures the workspace based on project type
- **AI-powered stdin processing**: `ps axf | oppla -` - Oppla intelligently formats and highlights the input
- **Starting Oppla with diagnostic AI**: `oppla --foreground` - Runs with AI-powered performance monitoring
- **Clean uninstallation**: `oppla --uninstall` - Safely removes Oppla and optionally preserves your AI training data

## Configure Oppla with AI Assistance

To open your custom settings with AI-powered recommendations for fonts, formatting settings, per-language configurations, and more, use the `Cmd+,` (macOS) or `Ctrl+,` (Linux) keybinding.

Oppla's AI will analyze your coding patterns and suggest optimal settings. To see all available settings with intelligent descriptions, open the Command Palette with `Cmd+Shift+P` and search for `oppla: open default settings`.

You can also explore all configuration options in the [Configuring Oppla](../configuring-oppla.mdx) documentation, where our AI assistant provides personalized recommendations.
