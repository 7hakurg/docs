## Current: Leveraging Zed's Extension Marketplace

**Right now, Oppla seamlessly integrates with Zed's extensive extension marketplace.** This strategic integration gives you immediate access to:

- **500+ existing extensions** covering languages, themes, and development tools
- **Mature, battle-tested ecosystem** with proven extension quality
- **Full compatibility** with Zed's extension APIs and development patterns
- **Automatic updates** and management through Zed's robust extension system

### How Extensions Work in Oppla

Since Oppla is built on Zed's high-performance foundation, you get:

```bash
# Install extensions exactly as you would expect
oppla extensions install <extension-name>
# Or through Oppla's intuitive settings interface
```

**Key Benefits:**
- **No learning curve** - if you know Zed extensions, you know Oppla
- **Immediate productivity** - access to extensions from day one
