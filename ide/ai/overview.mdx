Oppla isn't just an editor with AI features‚Äîit's an AI-first development platform that fundamentally reimagines how developers write, understand, and maintain code. Every aspect of Oppla is designed to amplify your intelligence and accelerate your workflow.

## Why Oppla's AI is Different

While other editors add AI as an afterthought, Oppla is architected from the ground up for seamless AI integration:

- **Context-Aware Intelligence**: Our AI understands your entire codebase, not just the current file
- **Predictive Development**: Anticipates your next actions based on patterns and intent
- **Adaptive Learning**: Personalizes to your coding style and preferences over time
- **Multi-Model Flexibility**: Choose from various AI providers or run models locally
- **Privacy-First Design**: Your code stays secure with granular privacy controls

## Getting Started with AI in Oppla

### Quick Setup (2 minutes)

1. **Open AI Settings**: Press `Cmd-,` (macOS) or `Ctrl-,` (Linux) and navigate to AI
2. **Choose Your Provider**: Select from Anthropic, OpenAI, Google AI, or local models
3. **Enter API Key**: Add your API key (or skip for local models)
4. **Start Coding**: AI features activate automatically!
