This page summarizes Oppla's subscription and billing model for individual developers, teams, and enterprises using AI features. It explains tiers, usage-based billing, quotas, trial options, and who to contact for enterprise plans.

## Overview

Oppla offers flexible plans to match different needs:

- Free — ideal for exploration, lightweight usage, and open-source contributors
- Individual (Pro) — for power users who want higher quotas, prioritized support, and advanced AI models
- Team — collaboration features, shared quotas, and centralized billing
- Enterprise — on-premise/local deployments, SSO & RBAC, audit logging, and dedicated support

AI features (completions, agents, edit prediction, model-hosting) are metered separately and may be subject to usage-based billing depending on provider and plan.

## Free Tier

- Access to core editor features and basic AI assistance
- Limited daily/monthly inference quota for cloud models
- Local models can be used without cloud billing (subject to hardware)
- Great for testing and onboarding — sign up to start a free trial of Pro features

## Individual (Pro)

- Higher model quotas and priority queuing for cloud requests
- Access to premium models and higher context windows (where available)
- Advanced agent features and extended audit history
- Monthly subscription billed via credit card or invoice (where supported)

Recommended for single developers who rely on AI for productivity and want predictable billing.

## Team

- Centralized team billing and quota pooling
- Role-based access controls and shared workspace limits
- Team admin console for monitoring usage, assigning seats, and policy controls
- Per-seat or pooled billing models (configurable)

Designed for small to medium engineering teams that need collaboration, governance, and cost control.

## Enterprise

- On-premise / air-gapped deployment options and local-only model support
- Enterprise-grade security: audit trails, encryption, SSO (SAML / OIDC), and RBAC
- Custom pricing, committed usage discounts, and dedicated onboarding
- SLA, priority engineering support, and professional services for migration/ops

Contact sales via enterprise@oppla.ai to discuss architecture, procurement, and compliance requirements.

## Usage-Based Billing & Quotas

- Cloud model usage is typically metered by input tokens, output tokens, or inference calls depending on the provider.
- Oppla surfaces usage in the team dashboard with per-user and per-project breakdowns.
- Quotas and soft limits are configurable at org and project level to prevent runaway costs.
- For local models, there is no cloud provider billing from Oppla — only operational costs for hosting models.

## Billing, Invoices & Payments

- Payment methods: Credit card (Stripe), invoicing for eligible teams, and purchase orders for enterprise customers.
- Invoices include line items for subscription seats and usage charges (if applicable).
- Billing portal available for admins to download invoices, update payment methods, and view usage history.
- Contact billing@oppla.ai for invoice support, tax documents, or billing disputes.

## Trial, Upgrade & Downgrade

- New accounts may be eligible for a free Pro trial for a limited period.
- Upgrades take effect immediately; prorated billing applies when switching plans mid-cycle.
- Downgrades are scheduled at the end of the current billing period to avoid data loss or abrupt quota changes.
- Admins can provision seats and set defaults for team onboarding.

## Enterprise Compliance & Procurement

- We support SOC2/ISO-ready practices for enterprise customers (deployment options and audit logs).
- For regulated environments, Oppla recommends local-only model deployments and review of the Privacy & Security documentation.
- Procurement and contract templates are available on request through enterprise@oppla.ai.

## Cost Controls & Best Practices

- Use a multi-model strategy: route cheap, fast models for everyday completions and reserve powerful models for heavy reasoning tasks.
- Configure per-project AI Rules and quotas to prevent accidental data exfiltration and cost spikes.
- Monitor usage dashboards and set alerts for high spend or anomalous usage patterns.
- Prefer local-first or local-only modes for sensitive codebases to minimize cloud provider traffic.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Are AI model costs included in my subscription?
A: Subscription tiers include seat-level features and baseline quotas. Model inference costs may be usage-based depending on model/provider and plan. Check your plan's detailed pricing page or contact billing.

Q: Can I use my own cloud provider account for model billing?
A: In some enterprise setups, you can route calls through your provider accounts. Contact sales for configuration details and supported providers.

Q: How do I prevent unexpected AI usage?
A: Configure per-project quotas and AI Rules, enable alerts on usage dashboards, and use local-only mode for sensitive projects.
