The Inline Assistant brings Oppla's AI directly into your code editor so you can get context-aware help without leaving the file. Use it for quick explanations, suggested edits, one-line fixes, documentation generation, and other small-scale tasks that benefit from immediate, low-latency assistance.

This page is a concise, actionable stub that explains core concepts, usage patterns, configuration options, privacy considerations, and troubleshooting. Full UX screenshots and GIFs will be added later.

## What is the Inline Assistant?

- Lightweight, in-place AI that analyzes the current buffer and surrounding context.
- Designed for short interactions: explain this function, suggest a fix, write a docstring, or convert a code snippet.
- Works with local or cloud models depending on your AI Configuration and AI Rules.
- Complements Edit Prediction (predicts edits as you type) and the Agent Panel (for multi-file or higher-risk tasks).

## Core capabilities

- Explain code: produce concise, line-by-line or function-level explanations.
- Quick fixes: propose single-file, low-risk edits (format, small refactors).
- Documentation: generate docstrings, README snippets, or code comments.
- Examples: produce example usage for functions or APIs.
- Small refactor hints: suggest variable renames or extract helpers (applied only with approval).
- Test suggestions: propose simple unit test templates for the current function.

## Quick start

1. Open a code file in Oppla.
2. Place the cursor on a symbol, select a code range, or highlight a function.
3. Invoke Inline Assistant:
   - Command Palette: `AI: Inline Assist`
   - Default keybinding: `Cmd-Shift-A` (macOS) / `Ctrl-Shift-A` (Linux)
4. Choose the action (Explain, Suggest Fix, Generate Tests, Add Docstring).
5. Inline suggestions will appear as ephemeral edits or as a preview panel — review before accepting.

Tip: Inline Assistant prefers small scopes (a single function or a code block) for the best results and lowest latency.

## Keyboard & UX

- Open Inline Assistant: Command Palette → `AI: Inline Assist`
- Accept inline suggestion: `Tab`
- Apply suggestion as patch: `Cmd-Enter` / `Ctrl-Enter`
- Dismiss: `Esc`
- Cycle alternatives: `Cmd-Right` / `Cmd-Left` (configurable)
- Trigger contextual help hover: `Alt-Enter` (or platform equivalent)

Customize these in your keymap. See Key Bindings for examples and advanced configuration.

## Configuration & settings

Inline Assistant settings live in the AI section of your settings file or preferences UI. Example settings (user-level):

```json
{
  "ai": {
    "inline_assistant": {
      "enabled": true,
      "local_first": true,
      "max_context_lines": 200,
      "suggestion_confidence_threshold": 0.6,
      "auto_accept_trivial_fixes": false
    }
  }
}
```

- local_first: Prefer a configured local runtime for privacy and lower latency.
- max_context_lines: How much surrounding code to send to the model.
- auto_accept_trivial_fixes: When true, trivial single-token or formatting fixes can be applied automatically (use with caution).

## Integration with other AI features

- Edit Prediction: Use inline suggestions for immediate edits while Edit Prediction offers next-step predictions as you type.
- Agent Panel: When a task requires multi-file changes or high-risk operations, the Inline Assistant will recommend using the Agent Panel instead.
- AI Rules: Inline Assistant respects AI Rules — any suggestion that would violate a rule is blocked or redacted.
- MCP & Tools: For verification (e.g., run tests), Inline Assistant can invoke tools via the Model Context Protocol if allowed by project settings.

## Privacy & security

- Default behavior: minimal outgoing context. Only the selected lines and a short surrounding window are sent to the model.
- Use local-only mode for air-gapped or sensitive projects (see AI Configuration).
- For cloud providers, the user must configure and permit provider usage. Inline Assistant will not send secrets or files matching AI Rules patterns.
- Audit logs: enterprise installs can log inline requests and responses for review (subject to redaction policies).

## Best practices

- Scope requests narrowly: select the function or block you want help with instead of the whole file.
- Review suggestions: always review AI edits before applying them, especially for security- or correctness-critical code.
- Use local-first on proprietary codebases to reduce risk of exfiltration.
- Combine with linters and tests: treat AI suggestions as first drafts and validate them with existing tooling.

## Troubleshooting

- No suggestions appear:
  - Ensure `ai.inline_assistant.enabled` is true.
  - Check AI provider availability and that credentials are configured (AI Configuration).
  - If using a local runtime, verify it is running and reachable.
- Suggestions are low quality:
  - Provide more focused context (open related files or select a larger range).
  - Try a different model or increase the confidence threshold.
- High latency:
  - Enable local_first or choose a lower-latency model.
  - Reduce `max_context_lines`.
- Suggestions blocked:
  - AI Rules may be redacting or blocking the required context (check project `.oppla/ai-rules.json`).

## Developer notes

- Extensions can implement custom inline handlers to provide domain-specific suggestions (for example, language-aware autofixes). Prefer structured suggestion outputs (patches, ranges, replacements).
- Keep outputs small and machine-friendly (JSON patches) to allow reliable application by the editor.
- Provide dry-run and preview modes for any extension-provided inline actions.
