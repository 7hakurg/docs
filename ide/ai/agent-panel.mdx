The Agent Panel is Oppla's interactive workspace for autonomous and semi-autonomous AI agents. Agents are specialized AI workflows that can understand project context, execute multi-step tasks, and produce or modify code across files while respecting your project rules and permissions.

This page is a stub that describes the Agent Panel's core concepts, primary workflows, security considerations, and links to related AI features. Full how-tos and deep-dive guides will be added soon.

## Quick summary

- Purpose: Run focused AI agents to automate complex developer tasks (refactors, migrations, bulk edits, documentation generation, testing).
- Access: Command Palette → "AI: Open Agent Panel" or use the keyboard shortcut (configurable).
- Safety: Agents run in a constrained environment with granular permissions and audit logging.
- Integrations: Works with AI Rules, Model Context Protocol (MCP), and external tools for enhanced capabilities.

## Open the Agent Panel

1. Open the Command Palette (Cmd+Shift+P / Ctrl+Shift+P).
2. Run: `AI: Open Agent Panel`.
3. Choose an agent from the gallery or create a new one using the "New Agent" button.
4. Provide the task prompt or select a predefined workflow (e.g., "Refactor imports", "Migrate to async/await", "Add unit tests for module").

Tip: You can pin frequently used agents to the panel for quick access.

## Core agent capabilities

- Project-aware analysis: Agents inspect the repository to build context (imports, modules, tests).
- Multi-file edits: Propose and apply changes across many files with preview and staged commits.
- Rules-aware behavior: Agents follow AI Rules that enforce style, safety, or project-specific constraints. See [AI Rules](./rules.mdx).
- Tool usage: Agents can call configured tools (linters, formatters, test runners) via the Model Context Protocol. See [AI Tools](./tools.mdx) and [Models](./models.mdx).
- Conversational control: Use a conversational thread to refine agent behavior while the task is running. See [Text Threads](./text-threads.mdx).
- Dry run / preview mode: Always preview changes before applying; use the built-in diff viewer.

## Typical agent workflows

1. Single-file task (quick fix)
   - Use an inline assistant or the Agent Panel to request a concise fix (e.g., "Simplify this function").
   - Agent proposes a patch; review and apply.

2. Multi-file refactor (medium risk)
   - Select "Refactor" agent and describe the transformation.
   - Review the agent's proposed changes across files in the staged preview.
   - Run unit tests with the agent before applying changes.

3. Full migration or architecture change (high risk)
   - Create an agent workflow that includes planning, a staged rollout, and tests.
   - Use "Canary" or "Incremental apply" options to apply changes in small batches.
   - Enable audit logging and require human approval before final commit.

4. Test generation and validation
   - Generate unit or integration tests for a target module.
   - Agent runs tests in an isolated sandbox and reports failures with suggestions.

## Configuration & customization

- Default model: Choose which model agents use for planning vs. execution in AI settings. See [AI Configuration](./configuration.mdx).
- Agent templates: Create and save project-specific agent templates for recurring tasks.
- Timeouts and retries: Configure per-agent timeouts and retry policies to avoid runaway tasks.
- Human-in-the-loop: Require approvals for changes above a given risk threshold.

## Permissions & safety

Oppla enforces layered safety controls for agents:

- Per-project permissions: Restrict which users or roles can run or approve agents.
- Scopes: Agents must request explicit scopes (read, write, run-tests, access-secrets). Admins can whitelist or blacklist scopes.
- Audit logging: Every agent run can be logged (who ran it, what model/provider was used, diffs proposed, approvals).
- Dry-run-first default: Agents open in preview mode by default; changes are not applied until explicitly approved.
- Rate limits & quotas: Prevent excessive automated changes by enforcing quotas.

See [Privacy & Security](./privacy-and-security.mdx) for details on data handling and encryption.

## Integrations

- Tools (linters, formatters, test runners): Agents can call external tools via the Model Context Protocol. See [AI Tools](./tools.mdx).
- Extension hooks: Extensions can register agent-aware hooks to add custom capabilities or validation steps.
- CI/CD: Export agent-produced patches as PRs or link them to your CI pipeline for validation.

## Troubleshooting & tips

- Agent produces unexpected changes:
  - Check the preview diff and rollback.
  - Re-run the agent with a narrower scope or explicit constraints.
  - Use AI Rules to encode prohibited transformations.

- Agent fails due to model limits:
  - Switch to a larger model for planning or enable multi-pass execution.
  - Reduce context size by focusing the agent on specific files.

- Tests fail after applying agent changes:
  - Use the Agent Panel to revert the last applied change.
  - Iterate with an agent configured to prioritize test passing.

## Best practices

- Start small: Run agents on unit-sized scopes before broad refactors.
- Use rules: Encode coding standards and safety checks to guide agents.
- Review diffs: Human review of proposed changes is essential for maintainability.
- Combine tools: Run linters and tests inside agent workflows to validate output.
- Track provenance: Keep notes in commits indicating which agent and prompt produced the changes.
