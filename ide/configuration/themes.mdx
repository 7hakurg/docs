Oppla comes with a collection of professionally designed themes, each optimized for AI-assisted coding with enhanced syntax highlighting that makes AI suggestions stand out clearly. Additional themes are available through our extension marketplace.

## Selecting a Theme with AI Recommendations

Access Oppla's intelligent Theme Selector via the command palette with "theme selector: Toggle" (bound to `Cmd-K Cmd-T` on macOS and `Ctrl-K Ctrl-T` on Linux).

As you navigate through the theme list, Oppla applies themes in real-time, and our AI learns your preferences to suggest themes based on:
- Your coding hours (day/night preferences)
- Language-specific optimal themes
- Eye strain reduction patterns
- Personal selection history

## Installing More Themes

Discover additional themes through the Extensions page, accessible via the command palette with "oppla: Extensions" or visit the [Oppla marketplace](https://oppla.ai/extensions).

Many popular themes have been intelligently adapted for Oppla, with AI-enhanced color schemes that improve code readability and reduce cognitive load. Visit [oppla-themes.com](https://oppla-themes.com) for a curated gallery with live previews and AI compatibility ratings.

## Configuring a Theme

Your selected theme preferences are stored in your settings file. Open your settings from the command palette with "oppla: Open Settings" (bound to `Cmd-,` on macOS and `Ctrl-,` on Linux).

Oppla's AI can maintain adaptive themes that automatically adjust based on ambient light, time of day, and your activity patterns:

```json
{
  "theme": {
    "mode": "ai_adaptive",
    "light": "Oppla Light",
    "dark": "Oppla Dark",
    "ai_optimization": {
      "auto_adjust": true,
      "eye_strain_reduction": true,
      "context_aware_highlighting": true
    }
  }
}
```

### Theme Modes

- **`"system"`**: Follow system appearance
- **`"dark"`**: Always use dark theme
- **`"light"`**: Always use light theme
- **`"ai_adaptive"`**: Let Oppla's AI optimize theme selection

## Theme Overrides with AI Assistance

Oppla's AI can suggest theme overrides based on your coding patterns. Use the `experimental.theme_overrides` setting to customize specific attributes:

```json
{
  "experimental.theme_overrides": {
    "editor.background": "#1a1a2e",
    "ai.suggestion.background": "#16213e",
    "ai.suggestion.border": "#F5A742",
    "syntax": {
      "comment": {
        "font_style": "italic",
        "foreground": "#6c757d"
      },
      "ai_generated": {
        "font_style": "bold",
        "foreground": "#F5A742"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### AI-Specific Theme Attributes

Oppla introduces special theme attributes for AI features:
- `ai.suggestion.background` - Background for AI code suggestions
- `ai.suggestion.border` - Border color for AI suggestions
- `ai.inline.hint` - Inline AI hint styling
- `ai.completion.highlight` - AI completion highlighting

## Local Themes

Store custom themes locally by placing them in the `~/.config/oppla/themes` directory. Oppla's AI will analyze your custom themes and suggest improvements for better readability and reduced eye strain.

For example, to create a theme called `my-ai-theme`, create `my-ai-theme.json` in that directory. Oppla will validate the theme and provide AI-powered suggestions for color improvements.

<Info>
**AI Theme Validation**: When you add a local theme, Oppla's AI automatically analyzes it for:
- Contrast ratios for accessibility
- Color harmony
- Syntax highlighting effectiveness
- Eye strain factors
